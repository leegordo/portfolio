## Overview

Fold is a fintech application that rewards users with Bitcoin for everyday purchases. As Head of Design, I led the complete redesign of the consumer experience — transforming a utilitarian crypto tool into an engaging, delightful product that made earning Bitcoin feel effortless.

## Challenge

The existing app struggled with user retention and onboarding completion rates. Users found the interface confusing, the value proposition unclear, and the overall experience disconnected from the excitement of earning Bitcoin. We needed to bridge the gap between complex financial technology and mainstream consumer expectations.

## Approach

I built and led a design team of four, establishing a comprehensive design system and user research practice from scratch. Our process centered on deep user understanding:

- **Research-led discovery** — Conducted 40+ user interviews and analyzed behavioral data to identify friction points across the entire user journey
- **Design system creation** — Built a scalable component library that unified the brand experience across iOS, Android, and web platforms
- **Iterative prototyping** — Ran weekly usability sessions with high-fidelity prototypes to validate design decisions before engineering investment
- **Cross-functional leadership** — Partnered closely with Product, Engineering, and Marketing to align on vision and ship cohesive experiences

The redesign touched every surface of the product — from onboarding flows and card activation to the core shopping experience and Bitcoin rewards visualization.

## Results

The impact was immediate and measurable:

- **3x improvement** in onboarding completion rates
- **47% increase** in daily active users within the first quarter post-launch
- **4.8-star** App Store rating, up from 3.2 stars
- Successfully scaled the design team from 1 to 4 designers while maintaining quality and velocity
- Established a research practice that became integral to the product development cycle

## Overview

Qantas, Australia's flagship airline, engaged our team to reimagine their digital booking and loyalty experience. As UX Director, I led the strategic design vision for transforming how millions of travelers interact with the Qantas brand across web and mobile platforms.

## Challenge

The airline industry was undergoing a massive digital transformation, and Qantas needed to compete with lean, digital-first travel platforms while maintaining the premium brand experience their customers expected. Their existing digital properties were fragmented — booking, loyalty, entertainment, and customer service all lived in disconnected experiences.

## Approach

I directed a team of designers and researchers to create a unified digital ecosystem:

- **Stakeholder alignment** — Facilitated design workshops with C-level executives to align on a shared digital vision across business units
- **Journey orchestration** — Mapped the complete traveler journey from trip inspiration to post-flight, identifying opportunities to create moments of delight
- **Responsive platform design** — Led the design of a responsive booking experience that maintained conversion rates while dramatically improving usability on mobile devices
- **Loyalty integration** — Wove the Frequent Flyer program naturally into every touchpoint, making points earning and redemption feel seamless rather than transactional

## Results

- Booking flow redesign achieved a 23% increase in mobile conversion rates
- Reduced average booking completion time by 35%
- Unified design language adopted across 6 digital products
- Framework became the foundation for Qantas's ongoing digital transformation program
