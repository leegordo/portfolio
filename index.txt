## Overview

Fold is a fintech application that rewards users with Bitcoin for everyday purchases. As Head of Design, I led the complete redesign of the consumer experience — transforming a utilitarian crypto tool into an engaging, delightful product that made earning Bitcoin feel effortless.

## Challenge

The existing app struggled with user retention and onboarding completion rates. Users found the interface confusing, the value proposition unclear, and the overall experience disconnected from the excitement of earning Bitcoin. We needed to bridge the gap between complex financial technology and mainstream consumer expectations.

## Approach

I built and led a design team of four, establishing a comprehensive design system and user research practice from scratch. Our process centered on deep user understanding:

- **Research-led discovery** — Conducted 40+ user interviews and analyzed behavioral data to identify friction points across the entire user journey
- **Design system creation** — Built a scalable component library that unified the brand experience across iOS, Android, and web platforms
- **Iterative prototyping** — Ran weekly usability sessions with high-fidelity prototypes to validate design decisions before engineering investment
- **Cross-functional leadership** — Partnered closely with Product, Engineering, and Marketing to align on vision and ship cohesive experiences

The redesign touched every surface of the product — from onboarding flows and card activation to the core shopping experience and Bitcoin rewards visualization.

## Results

The impact was immediate and measurable:

- **3x improvement** in onboarding completion rates
- **47% increase** in daily active users within the first quarter post-launch
- **4.8-star** App Store rating, up from 3.2 stars
- Successfully scaled the design team from 1 to 4 designers while maintaining quality and velocity
- Established a research practice that became integral to the product development cycle

## Overview

Lightning Labs is building the infrastructure for instant, high-volume Bitcoin transactions through the Lightning Network. I joined as Product Designer to humanize deeply technical protocols — making the Lightning Network accessible to developers and end-users who had never interacted with layer-2 Bitcoin technology.

## Challenge

The Lightning Network is incredibly powerful but notoriously complex. Developer documentation was sparse, tooling was fragmented, and the end-user experience of sending payments over Lightning felt like navigating a command line. We needed to lower the barrier to entry for both developers building on the protocol and consumers using Lightning-powered applications.

## Approach

Working at the intersection of protocol design and user experience, I focused on making the invisible visible:

- **Developer experience audit** — Mapped the complete developer journey from discovery to production deployment, identifying 12 critical friction points
- **Visual language creation** — Designed a visual system for representing abstract network concepts like channels, liquidity, and routing in intuitive ways
- **End-to-end payment flows** — Redesigned the payment experience to feel as simple as Venmo while maintaining the security properties of Bitcoin
- **Brand evolution** — Evolved the Lightning Labs brand to feel more approachable without losing its technical credibility

## Results

- Reduced developer onboarding time from days to hours through improved documentation design and interactive guides
- Payment flow redesign increased successful first-time transaction completion by 60%
- Brand refresh contributed to a significant increase in developer community engagement
- Design patterns established during this period have been adopted across the broader Lightning ecosystem

## Overview

Qantas, Australia's flagship airline, engaged our team to reimagine their digital booking and loyalty experience. As UX Director, I led the strategic design vision for transforming how millions of travelers interact with the Qantas brand across web and mobile platforms.

## Challenge

The airline industry was undergoing a massive digital transformation, and Qantas needed to compete with lean, digital-first travel platforms while maintaining the premium brand experience their customers expected. Their existing digital properties were fragmented — booking, loyalty, entertainment, and customer service all lived in disconnected experiences.

## Approach

I directed a team of designers and researchers to create a unified digital ecosystem:

- **Stakeholder alignment** — Facilitated design workshops with C-level executives to align on a shared digital vision across business units
- **Journey orchestration** — Mapped the complete traveler journey from trip inspiration to post-flight, identifying opportunities to create moments of delight
- **Responsive platform design** — Led the design of a responsive booking experience that maintained conversion rates while dramatically improving usability on mobile devices
- **Loyalty integration** — Wove the Frequent Flyer program naturally into every touchpoint, making points earning and redemption feel seamless rather than transactional

## Results

- Booking flow redesign achieved a 23% increase in mobile conversion rates
- Reduced average booking completion time by 35%
- Unified design language adopted across 6 digital products
- Framework became the foundation for Qantas's ongoing digital transformation program

## Overview

Nokia was expanding beyond telecommunications into the connected home space. I led UX Direction for their Smart Home platform — designing the experience layer for a suite of IoT devices including security cameras, environmental sensors, and a central hub that brought it all together.

## Challenge

The smart home market was crowded and confusing. Consumers were overwhelmed by competing ecosystems, complicated setup processes, and apps that required a PhD to navigate. Nokia needed a differentiated experience that leveraged their brand trust while making connected home technology genuinely accessible to non-technical households.

## Approach

We took a research-first approach, spending significant time in users' actual homes:

- **Contextual inquiry** — Conducted in-home research sessions with 30+ households across three countries to understand how people actually live with (and struggle with) connected devices
- **Ecosystem mapping** — Designed the information architecture for a platform that needed to gracefully scale from a single camera to a fully connected home
- **Setup experience** — Obsessed over the out-of-box experience, creating a setup flow that could be completed in under 3 minutes without reading a manual
- **Ambient interfaces** — Pioneered "calm technology" design patterns where the system works quietly in the background and only demands attention when truly needed
- **Multi-user design** — Created permission and personalization models for households where multiple family members with different technical abilities share the same system

## Results

- Setup completion rate of 94% — industry-leading for IoT devices at the time
- Average setup time under 3 minutes, compared to 15+ minutes for competitor products
- User satisfaction scores consistently above 4.5/5 across all markets
- Design patterns for ambient notification and calm technology were published and referenced across Nokia's broader product portfolio

> "Lee brought a rare combination of strategic thinking and human empathy to a deeply technical product challenge. His team's work set the standard for how we approach consumer IoT design." — Nokia Connected Home Division
