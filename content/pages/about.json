    "I'm Lee Gordon — a product designer with over 15 years of experience building digital products, leading design teams, and helping organizations understand the impact of thoughtful, research-driven design. My career has taken me from agency life at R/GA and DigitasLBi, through in-house roles at Nokia and Covetrus, to leading design at Fold where I built and scaled a design team that transformed their Bitcoin rewards product. I've worked across fintech, IoT, airlines, veterinary tech, and e-commerce — always bringing the same core philosophy: understand people deeply, then design with intention.\n\nToday, I'm bringing that experience to more clients while exploring AI and agentic interfaces. I believe the best designers understand their medium, keep up with rapid change, and build the things they design."
