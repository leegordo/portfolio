    "I'm Lee Gordon—a product designer with over 15 years of experience building things people actually use. My path has taken me from the high-paced agency world at R/GA and DigitasLBi, to in-house roles at Nokia and Covetrus, and eventually to leading the design team at Fold. I've worked across fintech, IoT, airlines, and e-commerce—always with the same focus: understand the human problem deeply, then build with intention.\n\nI'm a bit of a multi-tool by nature. Whether it's leading pure UX research for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, scaling design systems for global products, or getting heads-down in code to bring a concept to life, I move between the strategic and the tactical without losing the thread. \n\nLately, I've been focused on how AI is fundamentally changing the way we build. I believe the next generation of great design won't just be about pixels, but about building agentic interfaces that feel invisible and intuitive. I'm a firm believer that the best designers understand their medium—which is why I stay hands-on with the same tools and code I use to shape the future of AI-driven products."
