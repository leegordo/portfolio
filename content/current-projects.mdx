## Where I'm Working Right Now

Product design and agentic AI have the same core problem: figuring out what a system should do and making sure it doesn't get in the user's way. That overlap is where I spend most of my time.

## The Stack

I've rebuilt my workflow around a set of tools that let me move from idea to shipped product faster than any team I've worked with:

*   **Cursor & Claude Code:** Less time in the IDE, more time iterating on what actually matters.
*   **Figma + custom MCPs:** Design tokens and components that pipe directly into running code — no handoff friction.
*   **OpenClaw:** I run my own autonomous assistant (Lobo 🐺) that handles billing, business ops, and automated marketing workflows. Built it, use it daily.
*   **Veo & Nano Banana:** Google's video and image models for generating brand assets that would've taken a production team a week.

## Stashpay: Bitcoin for the Rest of Us

On the side, I've been building **[Stashpay](https://stashpay.me/)** with a partner — a Bitcoin/Lightning wallet built around radical simplicity. The design problem: make high-frequency Bitcoin transactions feel like any modern fintech app, for people who don't care how Lightning works under the hood.

## Active Client Work

### StickerGiant: AI-Driven E-Commerce
High-volume custom sticker and label printing. I'm working across three tracks:
*   **Design Systems:** Scalable components built for complex B2B and B2C flows.
*   **SOW Automation:** AI agents that generate Design Manager Statements of Work — cutting turnaround from days to minutes.
*   **E-commerce Optimization:** Reducing friction in product configuration and quoting for custom orders.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm taking on new work. If you're building an AI-native product and need a designer who can work at the code and agent layer — not just hand off Figma files — let's talk.
