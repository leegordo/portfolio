## Reimagining the Interface

I’m currently operating at the intersection of product design and agentic AI. This isn’t just about using AI as a tool—it’s about designing the future of how humans and machines collaborate. My daily workflow has shifted from "pixels only" to building intelligent systems that can think, execute, and iterate.

## The Multi-Tool Stack

I’m currently pushing the limits of a new "agentic" stack to deliver faster, smarter work for my clients:

*   **Cursor & Claude Code:** Moving beyond traditional IDEs into vibe-coding and agent-assisted development.
*   **Figma to Agent Workflows:** Bridging the gap between design tokens, visual components, and live code via custom MCPs (Model Context Protocol).
*   **OpenClaw:** Running my own autonomous personal assistant (Lobo 🐺) to handle business operations, billing, and automated marketing workflows.
*   **Veo & Nano Banana:** Leveraging Google's latest video and image models to create dynamic, high-end brand assets on the fly.

## Stashpay: Bitcoin for the Rest of Us

Alongside my client work, I’ve been building **[Stashpay](https://stashpay.me/)** with a partner. It’s a Bitcoin/Lightning wallet focused on radical simplicity. We’re applying everything I’ve learned about "invisible" UI to make high-frequency Bitcoin transactions feel as natural as any modern fintech app.

## Active Client Engagements

### StickerGiant: AI-Driven E-Commerce
I'm currently helping StickerGiant—a high-volume custom sticker & label printer—reimagine their entire customer journey.
*   **Design Systems:** Building scalable components that work across complex B2B and B2C flows.
*   **SOW Automation:** Researching and implementing AI agents to automate Design Manager Statement of Work (SOW) generation.
*   **E-commerce Optimization:** Streamlining product configuration and quoting to reduce friction for custom orders.

## What’s Next

I'm looking to bring this "Fractional AI Design Lead" approach to more organizations. Whether it's building agentic workflows for internal teams or designing the next generation of LLM-native interfaces, I'm excited about the work where design meets intelligence.
