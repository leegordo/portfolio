## Building the UX Layer for Bitcoin's Payment Network

Lightning Labs builds the infrastructure for the Lightning Network — a payment protocol that lets Bitcoin move at internet speed. When I joined, the products were built by engineers for engineers. My job was to make them usable by the rest of the world.

## The Design Challenge

The Lightning Network is technically complex by nature. Channels, routing, liquidity, nodes — concepts that require real mental model shifts for anyone coming from traditional finance. The design challenge wasn't simplification for its own sake, but knowing *which* complexity to expose and which to abstract.

## What I Built

Over four years, I worked across the full product suite:

- **Lightning Terminal** — a desktop dashboard for node operators managing channel liquidity. Took a command-line-only workflow and turned it into something a non-technical operator could run.
- **Pool** — a marketplace for buying and selling Lightning channel liquidity. Designed the core trading interface and onboarding from scratch.
- **Faraday** — analytics tooling for node operators. Focused on making routing data readable and actionable.
- **Brand system** — evolved the Lightning Labs visual identity as the company grew from a small protocol team to a recognized infrastructure provider.

## Results

* Shipped Lightning Terminal to thousands of node operators worldwide
* Brand refresh contributed to a significant increase in developer community engagement
* Design patterns established during this period have been adopted across the Lightning ecosystem
