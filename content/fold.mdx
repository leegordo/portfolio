## Overview

Fold is a fintech application that rewards users with Bitcoin for everyday purchases. As Head of Design, I led the complete redesign of the consumer experience — transforming a utilitarian crypto tool into an engaging, delightful product that made earning Bitcoin feel effortless.

## Challenge

The existing app struggled with consistency. As we added features at lightspeed, onboarding completion rates dropped and users began to find the interface confusing. The value proposition was getting lost, and the experience felt disconnected from the excitement of earning and saving in Bitcoin. We needed to bridge the gap between complex financial technology and the simplicity of a daily-use app.

## Approach

We established a comprehensive design system and user research practice from scratch. Our process centered on deep user understanding:

* **Research-led discovery** — Conducted 40+ user interviews and analyzed behavioral data to identify friction points across the entire user journey
* **Design system creation** — Built a scalable component library that unified the brand experience across iOS, Android, and web platforms
* **Iterative prototyping** — Ran regular usability sessions with high-fidelity prototypes to validate design decisions before engineering investment
* **Cross-functional leadership** — Partnered closely with Product, Engineering, and Marketing to align on vision and ship cohesive experiences

The redesign touched every surface of the product — from onboarding flows and card activation to the core shopping experience and Bitcoin rewards visualization.

## Results

The impact was immediate and measurable:

* **3x improvement** in onboarding completion rates
* **47% increase** in daily active users within the first quarter post-launch
* **4.8-star** App Store rating, up from 3.2 stars
* Successfully scaled the design team from 1 to 4 designers while maintaining quality and velocity
* Established a research practice that became integral to the product development cycle
