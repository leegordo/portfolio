## Overview

Qantas, Australia's flagship airline, engaged our team to reimagine their digital booking and loyalty experience. As UX Director, I led the strategic design vision for transforming how millions of travelers interact with the Qantas brand across web and mobile platforms.

## Challenge

The airline industry was undergoing a massive digital transformation, and Qantas needed to compete with lean, digital-first travel platforms while maintaining the premium brand experience their customers expected. Their existing digital properties were fragmented — booking, loyalty, entertainment, and customer service all lived in disconnected experiences.

## Approach

I directed a team of designers and researchers to create a unified digital ecosystem:

- **Stakeholder alignment** — Facilitated design workshops with C-level executives to align on a shared digital vision across business units
- **Journey orchestration** — Mapped the complete traveler journey from trip inspiration to post-flight, identifying opportunities to create moments of delight
- **Responsive platform design** — Led the design of a responsive booking experience that maintained conversion rates while dramatically improving usability on mobile devices
- **Loyalty integration** — Wove the Frequent Flyer program naturally into every touchpoint, making points earning and redemption feel seamless rather than transactional

## Results

- Booking flow redesign achieved a 23% increase in mobile conversion rates
- Reduced average booking completion time by 35%
- Unified design language adopted across 6 digital products
- Framework became the foundation for Qantas's ongoing digital transformation program
